## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pkg/plugins` inventory and capability probe package to discover:
  - built-in mail providers as `mail.send` capability providers
  - generic external plugins (`goframe-plugin-<provider>`)
  - legacy external mail plugins (`goframe-mail-<driver>`)
- New plugin diagnostics command group:
  - `goframe plugin list`
  - `goframe plugin doctor`
  - `goframe plugin test --provider <p> --capability <c>`
- Typed Plugin SDK v1 envelope and baseline capability schemas in `pkg/plugins`:
  - request/response envelopes (`version: v1`)
  - capability payload/output structs for `mail.send`, `queue.publish`, and `webhook.deliver`
  - external plugin executor with exit-code/retriable mapping
- Mail runtime bridge now supports capability plugins:
  - preferred external provider binary `goframe-plugin-<driver>` when `mail.send` is advertised
  - legacy fallback `goframe-mail-<driver>`
- Plugin runtime tests now cover success, provider error mapping, and timeout behavior for external execution.

### Changed

- `goframe sendtestemail` and deploy health messaging now reference generic plugin naming (`goframe-plugin-<driver>`) with legacy fallback details.
- Documentation consolidated with a canonical docs entrypoint (`docs/INDEX.md`), active-vs-historical separation, and refreshed cross-links.
- Fixed stale local absolute link in `docs/DETAILED_TUTORIAL.md` to a portable relative reference.
- Standardized documentation headers across `docs/` with consistent `Reference date` and `Status` metadata.
- Normalized documentation wording to avoid ambiguous temporal phrasing and align plugin-runtime terminology.
- README and plugin/mail docs updated with capability-based plugin command references.
- `docs/V0.6.0_ROADMAP.md` checklist updated for completed Plugin SDK baseline items.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-05

- `goframe startapp` command to scaffold a new app module inside an existing project.
- `goframe test` command to run `go test` with framework-friendly flags and `--dry-run`.

- `goframe diffsettings` command to compare effective configuration against framework defaults.

- `goframe testserver` command to run fixture-loading (`loaddata`) followed by server startup, with `--dry-run` support.
- `goframe createcachetable` command to provision database-backed cache table schema.
- `goframe clearsessions` command to purge expired sessions (or all sessions via `--all`) from SQL-backed session tables.

- `goframe remove_stale_contenttypes` command to purge orphan content-type rows based on current SQL tables, with `--dry-run` and production guardrails.
- `goframe ogrinspect` command to inspect geospatial SQL tables (`geometry`/`geography`) and generate Go model structs.

- `goframe optimizemigration` command to normalize and deduplicate SQL statements in migration files.
- `goframe squashmigrations` command to squash a migration range into one `.up.sql`/`.down.sql` pair, with optional source archiving.
- `goframe sendtestemail` command now validates and sends through configurable `mail_driver` (`smtp`, `sendgrid`, or external plugin `goframe-mail-<driver>`), with `--dry-run` mode.
- New `pkg/mail` provider architecture with:
  - provider registry via `mail.RegisterProvider(...)` for in-process extensions
  - built-in drivers `noop`, `smtp`, and `sendgrid`
  - external plugin bridge via executables named `goframe-mail-<driver>` on `PATH`
- `pkg/tasks` baseline with Asynq support for background jobs (enqueue + worker runtime).
- OpenTelemetry bootstrap (`pkg/observe/otel.go`) with OTLP traces/metrics initialization and graceful shutdown wiring from `app.New`.
- HTTP telemetry middleware with spans and request metrics in `pkg/router`.
- Configurable rate limiting middleware (fixed-window) based on user-id (when available) or client IP.
- `goframe new` scaffold now generates `cmd/worker/main.go` and `internal/tasks/article_events.go`, plus Redis/OTel/rate-limit config keys in `goframe.yaml`.
